Write a program that allows the user to enter the last names of ~five~ candidates in a local election and the votes received by each candidate. The program should then output each candidateâ€™s name, votes received by that candidate, and the percentage of the total votes received by the candidate. Your program should also output the winner of the election. A sample output is as follows:

```
Candidate     Votes Received     % of Total Votes
Johnson         5000                25.91
Miller          4000                20.73
Duffy           6000                31.09               
Robinson        2500                12.95
Sam             1800                9.33
Total           19300
The Winner of the Election is Duffy.
